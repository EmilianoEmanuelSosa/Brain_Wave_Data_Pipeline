# Brain_Wave_Data_Pipeline
This is my own project, in which I implement different technologies for the development of a pipeline that allows me to take data with Kafka, transform it with Pyspark and make it available in a datawarehouse with Postgres. Orchestrating it with Airflow and packaging it with Docker for Deploy.
